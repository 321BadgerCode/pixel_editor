<summary>How got ROYGBIV hex values?</summary>

To get the hex values for the ROYGBIV colors, Tkinter was used. This was done in order to make it cross-compatible with the level editor for the [Platformer Playground](https://github.com/321BadgerCode/platformer_playground) 2D game.

```py
import tkinter as tk

def rgb16_to_hex(rgb):
	return "#{:02x}{:02x}{:02x}".format(*(v // 256 for v in rgb))

colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "indigo", "violet"]

root = tk.Tk()
root.withdraw()

print("Tkinter ROYGBIV color hex values:")
for color in colors:
	rgb = root.winfo_rgb(color)
	hex_val = rgb16_to_hex(rgb)
	print(f"{color}: {hex_val}")

root.destroy()
```
